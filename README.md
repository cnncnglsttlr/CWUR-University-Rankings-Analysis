# CWUR University Rankings Analysis (2012–2015)

## Project Overview
This study analyzes the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) dataset (2012–2015) to uncover patterns in global higher education performance. Using statistical analysis, geographical visualization, regression modeling, and clustering, the project identifies key drivers of university rankings. The findings highlight the strong influence of research outputs—particularly publications and citations—on overall university performance, while also revealing regional concentration of top-ranked institutions in the USA and UK. Clustering analysis groups universities into performance tiers, and time-series exploration indicates a slight decline in average scores over the four years. These insights provide a clearer understanding of the dynamics behind university rankings, offering value to policymakers, institutions, and prospective students.

## Objectives
- Analyze global patterns in higher education rankings.  
- Explore how research output (publications, citations, patents) relates to university scores.  
- Identify clusters of universities with similar performance.  
- Evaluate trends in university performance over time.  

## Repository Structure
notebooks/ → analysis tasks (6.2–6.6)
case_study/ → project summary PDF
README.md → project documentation

## Key Findings
- Strong relationship between research output (publications, citations) and scores.  
- Clear country-level differences (e.g., USA, UK, Switzerland outperform others).  
- Overall decline in average university scores from 2012–2015.  
- Clustering reveals **3 distinct groups** of universities (high, medium, low performers).  

## Limitations
- Dataset only covers **2012–2015**.  
- Rankings may reflect methodological or cultural biases.  
- Gender and funding data are missing.  

## Next Steps
- Extend analysis with longer time series.  
- Include more factors (e.g., funding, international collaborations).  
- Compare CWUR with other ranking systems (QS, THE).
