# CWUR University Rankings Analysis (2012–2015)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Center for World University Rankings (CWUR)** dataset (2012–2015).  
The goal is to explore global university performance, identify key factors influencing rankings, and present findings through both **Python-based analysis** and an **interactive Tableau storyboard**.  

## Objectives
- Analyze global patterns in higher education rankings.  
- Explore how research output (publications, citations, patents) relates to university scores.  
- Identify clusters of universities with similar performance.  
- Evaluate trends in university performance over time.  

## Repository Structure
notebooks/ → analysis tasks (6.2–6.6)
case_study/ → project summary PDF
README.md → project documentation

## Key Findings
- Strong relationship between research output (publications, citations) and scores.  
- Clear country-level differences (e.g., USA, UK, Switzerland outperform others).  
- Overall decline in average university scores from 2012–2015.  
- Clustering reveals **3 distinct groups** of universities (high, medium, low performers).  

## Limitations
- Dataset only covers **2012–2015**.  
- Rankings may reflect methodological or cultural biases.  
- Gender and funding data are missing.  

## Next Steps
- Extend analysis with longer time series.  
- Include more factors (e.g., funding, international collaborations).  
- Compare CWUR with other ranking systems (QS, THE).
